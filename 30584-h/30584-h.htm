graduate seminars.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">i</span>
<h4><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<p>The Larpent collection of the Huntington Library contains the
manuscript copy of Charles Macklin’s COVENT GARDEN THEATRE, OR PASQUIN
TURN’D DRAWCANSIR in two acts (Larpent&nbsp;96) which is here reproduced
in facsimile.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a> It is an interesting example of that
mid-eighteenth-century phenomenon, the afterpiece, from a period when
not only Shakespearean stock productions but new plays as well were
accompanied by such farcical appendages.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2"
id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> This particular afterpiece is worth
reproducing not only for its catalogue of the social foibles of the age,
but as an illustration of satirical writing for the stage at a time when
dramatic taste often wavered toward the sentimental. It appears that it
has not been previously printed.</p>

<p>As an actor Charles Macklin is remembered for his Scottish dress in
the role of Macbeth, for his realistic portrayal of Shylock, for his
quarrel with Garrick in 1743, and for his private lectures on acting at
the Piazza in Covent Garden. He is less well known than he deserves as a
dramatist although there has been a recent revival of interest in his
plays stimulated by a biography by William W. Appleton, <i>Charles
Macklin: An Actor’s Life</i> (Harvard University Press, 1960) and
evidenced in “A&nbsp;Critical Study of the Extant Plays of Charles
Macklin” by Robert R. Findlay (PhD. Thesis at the State University of
Iowa, 1963). Appleton mentions that Macklin lost books and manuscripts
in a shipwreck in 1771 (p.&nbsp;150) and that play manuscripts may also
have disappeared in the sale of his books and papers at the end of his
long life at the turn of the eighteenth century. It is possible that
more of Macklin’s work may come to light, like <i>The Fortune
Hunters</i> which appeared in the National Library in Dublin. Until a
complete critical edition of Macklin’s plays appears, making possible
better assessment of his merit, such farces as THE COVENT GARDEN THEATRE
will have to stand as an example of one genre of eighteenth-century
theatrical productions.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why Macklin’s plays are less well known than
is warranted by his personality and acting ability
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
during his long association with the British stage. His first play,
<i>King Henry VII</i>, a&nbsp;tragedy hastily put together to capitalize
on the anti-Jacobite sentiment following the invasion attempt of 1745,
was an ambitious failure. After this discouragement, he also had trouble
with the Licenser so that his comedy <i>Man of the World</i> was not
presented until 1781, twenty years after a portion of it first appeared
at Covent Garden.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href =
"#note3">3</a> Nor were censorship and a bad start his only problems as
a playwright. He also, and apparently with good reason,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> was fearful of piracy
and was thus reluctant to have his plays printed. His eighteenth-century
biographer Kirkman mentions Macklin’s threats to “put the law against
every offender of it, respecting my property, in full force.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a> His biographers
also mention his practice of giving each actor only his own role at
rehearsals while keeping the manuscript copy of the whole play under
lock, but this did not prevent whole acts from being printed in such
magazines as <i>The Court Miscellany</i>, where Act I of
<i>Love-a-la-Mode</i> was printed as it was taken down in shorthand by
the famous shorthand expert Joseph Gurney. If Macklin had not been
required to submit copies of his plays to the Licenser, it is doubtful
that as much would have survived. The contentious Macklin had reason for
zealously guarding his manuscripts, with such provincial theatre
managers as Tate Wilkinson at York always anxious for new plays.</p>

<p>Finally, Macklin’s best work as a playwright was satiric enough and
topical enough to be short-lived in popularity even in his own day. Sir
Pertinax McSychophant in the <i>Man of the World</i> is a good
character, especially in his famous speech on the necessity of bowing to
get ahead in the world, as is Sir Archy MacSarcasm in <i><ins class =
"correction" title = "missing - at line break">Love-a</ins>-la-Mode</i>,
but the latter produced <i>A Scotsman’s Remarks on the Farce Love-a-la
Mode</i> in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for June, 1760, and
Macklin’s additional troubles with the Licenser would indicate that his
satiric barbs were not always well received.</p>

<p>Larpent manuscript 96, here reproduced, bears the application of John
Rich to the Duke of Grafton, dated 1752, for the Licenser’s permission
and an inscription to William Chetwynd, Esq. (spelled “Chetwyne” on
the&nbsp;MS.). It was extensively advertised before its one and only
performance in the Covent Garden Theatre on April&nbsp;8, 1752. The
advertisement printed in <i>The London Stage</i>, Pt.&nbsp;4, I, 305, is
taken from the <i>General Advertiser</i> and warns the public
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
not to confuse this farce with Charles Woodward’s <i>A Lick at the
Town</i> of 1751. The fact that the sub-title PASQUIN TURN’D DRAWCANSIR
carried an obvious allusion to Fielding’s pseudonym Alexander Drawcansir
in his <i>Covent Garden Journal</i>, and the fact that the <i>Covent
Garden Journal</i> carried the advertisement for Macklin’s play on March
14, 17, 21 and 28, 1752, before the single performance on April&nbsp;8,
1752, might suggest that Fielding may possibly have seen the script
before the play was produced. Esther M. Raushenbush in an article on
“Charles Macklin’s Lost Play about Henry Fielding,” <i>MLN</i>, LI
(1936), 505-14, points out that Macklin was not attacking Fielding in
this play as W.&nbsp;L. Cross and G.&nbsp;E. Jensen had earlier
suggested, but instead was trading on the popularity of Fielding’s
<i>Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers</i>, which
had appeared in January, 1751. Macklin’s farce makes clear reference to
Section III of Fielding’s pamphlet near the end of THE COVENT GARDEN
THEATRE where Pasquin delivers a lecture against Sharpers.</p>

<p>The advertisement for Macklin’s play in Fielding’s <i>Covent Garden
Journal</i> is the same as that printed in <i>The London Stage</i> from
the <i>General Advertiser</i>:</p>

<p class = "quotation">
a New Dramatic Satire ... written on the model of the Comedies of
Aristophanes or like Pasquinades of the Italian Theatre in Paris: with
the Characters of the People after the manner of Greek drama&mdash;The
parts of the Pit, the Boxes, the Galleries, the Stage, and the Town to
be performed By Themselves for their Diversion. The Parts of several
dull, disorderly characters in and about St. James, to be performed by
Certain Persons, for Example: and the part of Pasquin Drawcansir, to be
performed by his Censorial Highness, for his Interest.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> The Satire to be
introduced by an Oration and to conclude by a Peroration. Both to be
spoken from the Rostrum in the manner of certain Orators by Signior
Pasquin.</p>

<p>No cast remains, but presumably from references in the play itself,
Macklin took the role of Pasquin who with the aid of Marforio calls
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
in review characters representing all the foibles of the age. There is
no plot. Act I simply ends while Pasquin and the Spectators retire to
the Green Room to await the appearance of those characters whom Marforio
has called in review.</p>

<p>In this ambitious attempt to list all the follies of his age, Macklin
employs the popular technique of eighteenth-century plays such as
Fielding’s <i>The Author’s Farce</i>&mdash;the play appears to be
writing itself on the stage. He displays all the tricks of
satire&mdash;exaggeratedly ironic praise, allegorical names (Miss
Giggle, Miss Brilliant, Miss Bashfull), stock characters of satire
(Pasquin, Marforio, Hydra, Drawcansir), lists of offenses, parodies of
polite conversation reminiscent of Swift, and constant topical
references: to the Robin Hood Society to which little Bob Smart belongs;
to Mother Midnight; to playwrights (Fielding, Foote, Woodward, Cibber,
and himself); to contemporary theatrical taste (Pantomime, Delaval’s
<i>Othello</i> which Macklin himself had coached, Harlequins,
Masquerades, and various theatrical tricks); to Critics (Bonnell
Thornton, who later reviewed this afterpiece, is called Termagent since
Thornton’s pseudonym was “Roxana Termagent”; John Hill is referred to as
the “Inspector” of the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>; and Fielding is called
Sir Alexander Drawcansir). The farce abounds in these topical
references, from Pasquin’s opening invocation to Lucian, “O&nbsp;thou,
who first explored and dared to laugh at Public Folly,” to its closing
lecture against Sharpers like Count Hunt Bubble where the obvious
allusions to Section III on Gaming of Fielding’s <i>Enquiry</i> ... are
applauded by Solomon Common Sense, the voice of Reason.</p>

<p>This vast parade of fashions and foibles with frequent thinly veiled
references to individuals may explain the numerous Licenser’s marks on
the manuscript. If all the marked lines were omitted, it is small wonder
that this afterpiece was performed only once. Dramatic satire, without
plot, is difficult to sustain even in farce, and if the marked lines
were cut, there was little left to recommend the play. It is not
surprizing that the Licenser objected to such passages as the
description of Miss Giggle’s “nudities,” but his frequent objections to
topical and personal references took all the bite out of Macklin’s
satire.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<p>Like Macklin’s other early farces, THE COVENT GARDEN THEATRE contains
proto-characters for his later plays. Sir Roger Ringwood,
a&nbsp;“five-bottle man,” who rode twenty miles from a “red-hot Fox
Chace” to appear before Pasquin, is an early study for Macklin’s later
hard-drinking, fox-hunting Squire Groom in <i>Love-a-la Mode</i> or Lord
Lumbercourt in <i>The Man of the World</i>. But Macklin’s usual good ear
for dialogue is missing from this play, nor is any character except his
own as Pasquin followed long enough to make his characteristic speech
identifiable. Since plot is absent too, all that remains is the wealth
of topical and personal satire which in itself is interesting to the
historian of the mid-eighteenth-century theatre. If THE COVENT GARDEN
THEATRE is studied along with his other two unpublished afterpieces in
the Larpent collection (A&nbsp;WILL AND NO WILL, OR A BONE FOR THE
LAWYERS and THE NEW PLAY CRITICIZ’D, OR THE PLAGUE OF ENVY), Macklin’s
skill at satiric comedy after his initial abortive attempt at tragedy
can be seen as developing steadily toward such later full-length
comedies as the better known <i>Love-a-la Mode</i> (1759) and <i>The Man
of the World</i> (1764). His recognition that tragedy was not his forte
and his self-criticism in THE COVENT GARDEN THEATRE, where he exhorts
the audience to “explode” him when he is dull, reveal the comic spirit
operative in his sometimes cantankerous personality. It is that strain,
here seen in genesis, which develops full-fledged in his later
comedies.</p>

<p>A word should be added about the Dramatis Personae for the play. It
does not contain the Stage-Keeper, who speaks only once, the Servant
whose single word is accompanied by the stage direction “This Servant is
to be on from the beginning,” nor the Romp (probably the Prompter, who
speaks twice off-stage during the play). Hic and Haec Scriblerus,
however, although he is listed in the cast of characters, speaks only
once, and his entrance on stage is never indicated.</p>

<p>The “naked lady,” Lady Lucy Loveit, whose entrance causes so much
excitement, is described as appearing in a Pett-en-l’air, which
eighteenth-century costume books portray as a short, loose shift!</p>

Patience to you all. I&nbsp;Seignior Pasquin, of the <ins class =
"authcorr" title = "corrected from ‘Quorom’">Quorum</ins> of Parnassus.
Drawcansir and Censor of Great Britain, by my Bills and Advertisements,
have Summoned You together this Night to hear a Public Examination of
several Public Nusances, My Scene I have laid in the Common Theatre,
which is my usual place of exposing
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page2" id = "page2">2</a></span>
those Knaves and Fools, who despise the Moral&mdash; and those who are
too great or too Subtle for the common Law, and as my whole design <ins
class = "correction" title = "or ‘be’: smudged margin">is</ins> new,
I&nbsp;hope You, my Gracious Patrons, will not be Offended if I Assigne
you a part in this Pasquinade, which is this,&mdash; You are to Act as a
Chorus to the whole. When you behold a Fool pleasantly exposed You are
to laugh, if you please, not else;&mdash; When a Knave is Satyrized with
Spirit &amp; Wit, You are to Applaud;&mdash; and when Pasquin is dull
you are to explode, which I Suppose will be the Chief of Your Part. But,
before I Enter upon my Office of Public Censor, give me leave Gracious
Patrons, as is my Custom, whenever I come, to give a short Sketch of my
Character and Practice. I&nbsp;am known throughout the Globe, have been
Caress’d in most of the Courts,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page3" id = "page3">3</a></span>
lock’d up in most Prisons in Europe. The dexterity of my Flattery has
introduced me to the Tables of the First Dons in Madrid one Day, and,
the boldness of my Satyr, into the Inquisition next. I&nbsp;have Revel’d
with the Princes of the Blood, and have made all Paris laugh at my Wit
over Night, and, have had the Honour of being in the Bastile the next
Morning. indeed I fared but indifferently in Holland;
<span class = "pagenum">3a</span>
for, all that my Flattery, or Satyr, my Ridicule or my Wit, cou’d
procure me there, was an Appartment in the Rasp House. At length, most
Gracious and Indulgent Britons, I&nbsp;am arrived in this Great
Metropolis! this Magazine of all the World! this Nurse of Trade! this
Region of Liberty! this School of Arts and Sciences! This Universal
Rendevouz of all the Monsters produced by wagish Nature &amp; fantastick
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page4" id = "page4">4</a></span>
Art, here Panopticons, Microcosms, Bears, Badgers, Lyons, Leapords,
Tygers, Panthers, Ostriches and Unicorns,&mdash; Giants, dwarfs,
Hermorphradites and Conjurers, Statemen, Nostrums, Patriots and
Corncutters! Quacks, Turks, Enthusiasts, and Fire Eaters. Mother
Midnights, Termagants, Clare Market, and Robin Hood Orators, Drury Lane
Journals, Inspectors, Fools, and Drawcansirs, dayly Tax the Public by
Virtue of the Strangeness the Monstrosity or delicacy of their Nature or
Genius, And hither I am come, knowing you were fond of Monsters, To
exhibit Mine, the newest &amp; I hope the greatest Monster of them all,
for the Public is a common Bank, upon which every Genius and every
Beauty has a right to draw in proportion to their merit, from a Minister
of State and a Maid of Honour, down to a Chien Savant or
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page5" id = "page5">5</a></span>
a Covent Garden Mistress, To Conclude, my Business in this Land may be
Sum’d up in a few Words; it is to get your money and cure you of Your
Foibles. for wherever Pasquin comes the Public is his Patient; its Folly
his Support. (<span class = "smaller">bows</span>) So much by way of

You must know, my dear, the History of the Lady
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page46" id = "page46">46</a></span>

her mind a Composition of Hypocrisy and Vanity; her Head, like the Study
of Don Quixot, Stuffed with the exploded&mdash; Romances&mdash; of the
two last Centuries&mdash; her Style the quaint Quintessence of Romantic
Fustian, and her Manners those of a Princess in an Inchanted Castle.</p>

The Character I mean Sir, is not immaginary, invented by Slander and

Sir you don’t know half the Villany of these Men. Play, in its most
Honourable Commerce, is a pernicious Vice, but as Luxury, Fashion and
Avarice, have improved it all over Europe, It is now become an avow’d
System of Fraud and Ruin. The virtuous and Honourable, who Scorn
Advantage, are a constant Prey to the vicious and dishonourable, who
never Play without one. nor does the Vice Stop here: For the Sharper
having Stript his Bubble of his Estate, he next Corrupts his Mind, by
making him a Decoy-Duck, in Order to retrieve his Fortune as he lost It.
And, from an indegent Virtuous Bubble, the Noble Youth becomes an
Affluent vicious Sharper.</p>

advised, by some Dramatick Friends, not to let it appear too soon. For
Love, in a Farce, they said, was generally very dull, and what the
English Audience always Complain’d of. But now we are come to unravel
the Plot&mdash; It must be known, that Lady Lucy, M<sup>r</sup>. Hydra,
Sir Eternal, Miss Brilliant, and all the Characters, have a most
Passionate Tendre for each other, and have Privately agreed that this
shall be the Happy Night. And, as to a Wedding, I&nbsp;have taken
particular Care of that, for among the disorderly Persons that were
Seized, by mistake, they have taken up a Gentleman that lives near May
Fair, who waits in the Green Room to Sign the Passport of each loving
Pair to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page66" id = "page66">66</a></span>

Upon Honour, I am of your Opinion M<sup>r</sup>. Pasquin. And I like
your Catastrophes extremely. M<sup>r</sup>. Common Sense, what is your
Opinion?</p>

<p class = "speech">Com.
For my part Sir, I am pleased with the whole Piece, and think the
Critics, in particular, must approve of it highly; As it is written up
to the Strictest Nicety of Dramatic Rules. Against the next Night,
M<sup>r</sup>. Pasquin, you must omit, or alter some exceptionable
Expressions, And, if you were to prune a few Redundances, the whole
Piece wou’d be the better for&nbsp;it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page67" id = "page67">67</a></span>
<p class = "speech">Pas.
Your Criticism, M<sup>r</sup>. Common Sense, is always Iust, and I shall
implicitly observe&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "speech">Com.
And now, M<sup>r</sup>. Pasquin, the sooner you come to your Peroration
the better.</p>

<p class = "speech">Omn.
Ay, ay, the Peroration, the Peroration&mdash; come, Mount the Rostrum,

Most August, Respectable, and Tremendous Public! whose Power is as
uncontrolable as the Boundless Winds, whose Iudgement infalable as
opposeless Fate, Whom Party cannot Sway, Fear Intimidate, Flattery

<p class = "speech">Hyd.
Harkée, harkée, Domine Pasquin, this Panegerick is quite out of
Character, and Shews great Ignorance of the People You are Addressing.
For know Sir, that the British Public has too much Dignity and Sense,
either to give, or to recieve, Flattery. Your best way of gaining their
Esteem, is by preserving Your Character, to the last, of a General
Satyrist my Dear, not. by degenerating to a Public Sycophant.</p>

<p class = "speech">Pas.
I am afraid Sir, I have been too free of my Satyr already.</p>

<p class = "speech">Com.
Not at all Sir.&mdash; while it is General and Circumscribed by decency,
it cannot be too strong for the English. For Our Wit, Sir,

<p class = "speech">Bob.
Right, Right&mdash; Dem me, my dear give us Satyr, keen cutting Satyr,
that’s what Pleases Us&mdash; And as to Your Panegeric, take that to
Madrid or Paris.</p>

<p class = "speech">Com.
M<sup>r</sup>. Pasquin, the Public know they have Follies, as well as
Individuals; and, so far from being Angry with the Man, who ridicules
them, they always reward him with Approbation and Esteem.</p>

<p class = "speech">
Pas:
Why then Sir, under the Protection of the Town, and the Patronage of
Common Sense, I&nbsp;will, like a faithfull Painter, not a modern
Dedicator, finish up the Blemishes as highly as I have the Beauties of
my Patron.</p>

<p class = "speech">Bob.
Ay, now, now for the Town, I should be glad to see our own blind side.
be sure to be Severe, give us no Quarter.</p>

Splenitic, as to damn a Cibber, and, even a Congreve, in the Way of the

Queen Mab, or a Man in a Bottle.</p>

<p class = "speech">Hyd.
Why, the Town are a little whimsical sometimes I believe? I beg pardon
M<sup>r</sup>. Pasquin for breaking in upon You.</p>

<p class = "speech">Pas.
O no Offence, Sir, the Town has always a right to interrupt, and disturb
a Performance. It is their Prerogative, <ins class = "authcorr" title =

Breeding</ins></p>

<p class = "speech">Hyd.
You are right&mdash; go on, go on,&mdash; a good Sensible Fellow, and

You are a Being, composed of all the Virtues

and Vices, Wisdom and Folly of Human Nature. All Men dread you; all Men
Court you; All Men love You&mdash; and yet All Men strive to be
independent of You. For you are so inconsistent, that you are Constant
in nothing, but Inconstancy&mdash;&mdash; So good Natur’d, so techy, so
wise&mdash; and sometimes so otherwise&mdash; In Short, so much every
thing, that were the whole Sisterhood of the imitative Arts in emulous
Association joyn’d, with the Genius of your own Great Shakespear at

the Springs of every Public Character, and are this Night of Pasquin.
inspired by them he has dar’d laugh at Female Folly and to lash a Noble
Vice that Lords it in Our most Polite Assemblies. For which, he who was
late a Iudge and Public Censor in turn, now trembles at Your dread
Tribunal. The first and last Appeal of Players, Poets, Statesmen,
Fidlers, Fools, Philosophers and Kings. If, by the boldness of his
Satyr, or the daring Novelty of his Plan and Fable,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page73" id = "page73">73</a></span>
He has offended, He ought to meet with some degree of Candour, as his
Offence was the Effect of a Noble Gratitude, and an Over-heated Zeal to
Please His Noble Guests &amp; Patrons, whom he Scorn’d to treat with
Vulgar Cates Season’d and Serv’d with Flattery and Common Dramatic Art.
For this boldness of his Satyr, this is his Defence&mdash; But, for his
dulness, he has no Plea. If You Almighty Arbiters find him guilty of
that Offence, censure him as freely as he has censured others. And, like
the Roman Censor, he will cry out with Patriot Ioy, What Pity ’tis,
a&nbsp;Blockhead can be damn’d but once, to Please the Critics.</p>
